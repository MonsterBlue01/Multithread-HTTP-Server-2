Terms:
1. Response time: Also called execution time. The total time required for the computer to complete a task, including disk accesses, memory accesses, 
    I/O activities, operating system overhead, CPU execution time, and so on.
2. Throughput: Also called bandwidth. Another measure of performance, it is the number of tasks completed per unit time.
3. CPU execution time: Also called CPU time. The actual time the CPU spends computing for a specific task.
4. User CPU time: The CPU time spent in a program itself.
5. System CPU time: The CPU time spent in the operating system performing tasks on behalf of the program.
6. Clock Cycle: Also called tick, clock tick, clock period, clock, or cycle. The time for one clock period, usually of the processor clock, which runs at a 
    constant rate.
7. Clock Period: The length of each clock cycle.
8. Clock Cycles Per Instruction (CPI): Average number of clock cycles per instruction for a program or program fragment.
9. Instruction mix: A measure of the dynamic frequency of instructions across one or many programs.

Formulas:
1. Performance = 1 / Excution time
2. CPU execution time = CPU clock cycles for a program for a program * Clock cycle time
3. CPU execution time for a program = CPU clock cycles for a program / Clock rate
4. CPU clock cycles = Instructions for a program * Average clock cycles per instruction
5. CPU time = Instructioncount * CPI * Clock cycle time
6. CPU time = Instruction count * CPI / Clock rate
7. CPU clock cycles = CPI * C
8. Power ratio = Power_new / Power_old
9. Power = Capacitive load * Voltage ^ 2 * Frequency Switched
