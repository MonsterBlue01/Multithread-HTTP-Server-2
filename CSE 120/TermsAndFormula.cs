Terms:
1. Response time: Also called execution time. The total time required for the computer to complete a task, including disk accesses, memory accesses, 
    I/O activities, operating system overhead, CPU execution time, and so on.
2. Throughput: Also called bandwidth. Another measure of performance, it is the number of tasks completed per unit time.
3. CPU execution time: Also called CPU time. The actual time the CPU spends computing for a specific task.
4. User CPU time: The CPU time spent in a program itself.
5. System CPU time: The CPU time spent in the operating system performing tasks on behalf of the program.
6. Clock Cycle: Also called tick, clock tick, clock period, clock, or cycle. The time for one clock period, usually of the processor clock, which runs at a 
    constant rate.
7. Clock Period: The length of each clock cycle.
8. Clock Cycles Per Instruction (CPI): Average number of clock cycles per instruction for a program or program fragment.
9. Instruction mix: A measure of the dynamic frequency of instructions across one or many programs.
10. Workload: A set of programs run on a computer that is either the actual collection of applications run by a user or constructed from real programs to 
  approximate such a mix. A typical workload specifies both the programs and the relative frequencies.
11. Benchmark: A program selected for use in comparing computer performance.
12. Amdahlâ€™s Law: A rule stating thatthe performance enhancement possible with a given improvement is limited by the amount that the improved 
feature is used. It is a quantitative version of the law of diminishing returns.
13. Million Instructions Per Second (MIPS): A measurement of program execution speed based on the number of millions of instructions. MIPS is 
  computed as the instruction count divided by the product of the execution time and 106.

Formulas:
1. Performance = 1 / Excution time
2. CPU execution time = CPU clock cycles for a program for a program * Clock cycle time
3. CPU execution time for a program = CPU clock cycles for a program / Clock rate
4. CPU clock cycles = Instructions for a program * Average clock cycles per instruction
5. CPU time = Instructioncount * CPI * Clock cycle time
6. CPU time = Instruction count * CPI / Clock rate
7. CPU clock cycles = CPI * C
8. Power ratio = Power_new / Power_old
9. Power = Capacitive load * Voltage ^ 2 * Frequency Switched
10. Execution time after improvement = Execution time affected by improvement / Amount of improvement + Execution time unaffected
11. MIPS = Instruction count / (Execution time 10^6) = Instruction count / ((Instruction count * CPI / clock rate) * 10 ^ 6) = clock rate / CPI
* 10 ^ 6
12. Seconds / Program = (Instructions / Program) * (Clock cycles / Instructions) * (Seconds / Clock Cycle)
