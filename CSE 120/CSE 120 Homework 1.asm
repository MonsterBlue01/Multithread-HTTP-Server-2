1. Just get the multiplication and get the addition. CPI = 0.2 * 1 
    + 0.4 * 2 + 0.1 * 3 + 0.3 * 4 = 2.5. IPC = 1 / 2.5 = 0.4.
2. LD and other have the largest fractions. So we pick these two.
3. Even removing the Other part doesn't achieve that amount of 
    speedup. So it's not possible.
    ; How to calculate the speedup?
