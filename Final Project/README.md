# Final Project: Implementing a Simple Router

This repository contains the resources and documentation for a Network Design and Implementation Project. The project encompasses the construction of a network topology and the configuration of a POX controller.

## Content Overview:

1. `final_skel.py` - This Python script describes the network topology construction. The structure of the network is defined here, which includes hosts, switches, and how they are interconnected.
2. `finalcontroller_skel.py` - This Python script establishes the POX controller setup. It describes the network policy and rules to manage the network traffic between different nodes. The policy involves handling of ICMP and IP traffic, including rules to allow or block the traffic based on predefined conditions.
3. `README.md` - This file provides an introduction and an overview of the other files in the repository.
4. `project.pdf` - This is a comprehensive lab report of the project. It provides an in-depth explanation of the design and execution of the network configuration. This document includes various test results of the network performance and behaviour under different conditions. Each test result is accompanied by a screenshot for a better understanding of the network functioning. The conclusions drawn from these results provide valuable insights into the network's effectiveness and adherence to the required policies.
