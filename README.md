# Multithread HTTP Server

## Overview
This project is a continuation and enhancement of a multithreaded HTTP server I originally developed for a school assignment. Initially completed under challenging circumstances due to a staff strike, this version has been significantly improved, adding robustness and new features.

## Files Description
- **cacher.c/h**: Implements caching functionality with various policies.
- **httpserver.c**: The main server file handling HTTP requests.
- **log.c/h**: Provides logging capabilities throughout the server.
- **Makefile**: Simplifies compilation and building of the project.
- **queue.c/h**: Manages a queue for handling requests.
- **test_httpserver.sh**: A script for testing server functionality.

## Enhanced Features
The current version of this server not only runs flawlessly but also includes enhanced features like improved caching mechanisms, better request handling, and comprehensive logging.
