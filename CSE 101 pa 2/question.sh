#1. So basically, getOrder() is the way to track the Graph?
#2. Each node only has one parent?
#3. Each node has unique value?
#4. Should we use append twice? (bi-direction graph?)
#5. How to use 'n' that in the newGraph?
#6. Do we need to allocate the space for neighbor in newGraph? or allocate it when we need that later?
#7. Why add edge and add arch should use two different functions? Are they doing same things?
