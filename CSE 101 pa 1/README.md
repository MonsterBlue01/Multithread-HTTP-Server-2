# Programing Assignment 1

## Files:
- List.h: The header file of *List.c*.
- List.c: The C file that contains **ADT**.
- ListTest.c: The own test of **List ADT**.
- Lex.c: The main file to run **ADT**.
- Makefile: It contains lots of rules for *Make*.
- README: The file that you are reading. It contains some information of all project.

## Notes:
Sometimes I can't run the grading script (the one posted on github) although I always used same files. It always returned **Files can't be found**. I am sure it's not caused by files. I uploaded my lastest version that can pass the grading script (no matter if functions work). I hope it will not abort the grading scripts. Just a heads up. Thanks.
